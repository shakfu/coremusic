## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **AudioConverter API** - Complete audio format conversion framework
  - Functional API with 13 wrapper functions for AudioConverter operations
  - `audio_converter_new()`, `audio_converter_dispose()`, `audio_converter_convert_buffer()`
  - `audio_converter_get_property()`, `audio_converter_set_property()`, `audio_converter_reset()`
  - 6 property ID getter functions for converter configuration
  - Object-oriented `AudioConverter` class with automatic resource management
  - Context manager support for safe resource cleanup
  - Support for stereoâ†”mono conversion, bit depth changes, and format conversions

- **ExtendedAudioFile API** - High-level audio file I/O with automatic format conversion
  - Functional API with 14 wrapper functions for ExtendedAudioFile operations
  - `extended_audio_file_open_url()`, `extended_audio_file_create_with_url()`
  - `extended_audio_file_read()`, `extended_audio_file_write()`, `extended_audio_file_dispose()`
  - `extended_audio_file_get_property()`, `extended_audio_file_set_property()`
  - 7 property ID getter functions for file format access
  - Object-oriented `ExtendedAudioFile` class with context manager support
  - Automatic format conversion on read/write via client format property
  - Simplified file I/O compared to lower-level AudioFile API

- **Comprehensive test coverage** for new APIs
  - `test_audiotoolbox_audio_converter.py` - 12 functional API tests
  - `test_audiotoolbox_extended_audio_file.py` - 14 functional API tests
  - `test_objects_audio_converter.py` - 29 object-oriented wrapper tests
  - Tests cover creation, conversion, I/O operations, property access, error handling
  - Real-world testing with actual audio files

- **Exception hierarchy** expanded
  - Added `AudioConverterError` for converter-specific exceptions
  - Proper error propagation with detailed error messages

### Changed

- Enhanced `AudioFormat` class integration with converter APIs
- Improved error handling consistency across audio conversion operations

### Fixed

- Fixed UID string handling in `AudioDevice._get_property_string()` to strip both leading and trailing null bytes (changed from `.rstrip('\x00')` to `.strip('\x00')`)
- Improved `test_audio_device_manager_find_by_uid` test resilience to handle devices with inconsistent UID encoding
