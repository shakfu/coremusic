class BufferPool:
    """Thread-safe buffer pool for reusing allocated buffers.

    This class manages a pool of pre-allocated buffers to reduce memory
    allocation overhead in audio processing. Buffers are organized by size
    for efficient reuse.

    Attributes:
        max_buffers_per_size: Maximum buffers to cache per size
        total_allocated: Total number of buffers allocated
        cache_hits: Number of times a buffer was reused
        cache_misses: Number of times a new buffer was allocated

    Example::

        # Create a buffer pool
        pool = BufferPool(max_buffers_per_size=10)

        # Acquire buffer for audio processing
        buffer = pool.acquire(8192)  # 8KB buffer

        # ... audio processing ...

        pool.release(buffer)

        # Check statistics
        print(f"Hit rate: {pool.hit_rate:.2%}")

    Notes:
        - Thread-safe for concurrent access
        - Automatically grows to accommodate demand
        - Implements least-recently-used eviction
        - Buffers are NOT zeroed on reuse for performance
