## Missing/Unwrapped APIs

### 1. **AudioWorkInterval** (macOS 10.16+, iOS 14.0+)
**Priority: Medium-Low** - Advanced feature for realtime workgroup management

**What it provides:**
- OS workgroup creation for realtime audio threads
- Thread deadline coordination across processes
- CPU usage optimization for power vs. performance

**Relevance:** Highly specialized - needed only for advanced audio apps creating custom realtime threads. Most apps use device-owned workgroups automatically.

**Recommendation:** Low priority - niche use case for professional audio developers.

---

### 2. **CoreAudioClock** (macOS-only)
**Priority: Medium** - Synchronization and timing services

**What it provides:**
- Audio/MIDI synchronization
- SMPTE timecode support
- MIDI Time Code (MTC) and MIDI beat clock
- Tempo maps and time conversions
- Clock sources (audio devices, host time, external sync)

**Relevance:** Essential for DAWs, sequencers, and sync-dependent applications. Overlaps partially with MusicPlayer tempo functionality but provides broader sync capabilities.

**Recommendation:** Medium priority - would enhance pro audio and post-production use cases.

---

### 3. **AudioHardwareTapping** (macOS 14.2+)
**Priority: Low** - Recent addition, Objective-C only

**What it provides:**
- Process audio tapping (capture audio from other processes)
- Requires Objective-C (`CATapDescription` class)

**Relevance:** Very specialized - audio monitoring/routing utilities, system-wide audio capture.

**Recommendation:** Low priority - requires Objective-C bridge, limited applicability.

---

### 4. **CAFFile Data Structures**
**Priority: Low** - Informational only

**What it provides:**
- Core Audio Format (CAF) file chunk definitions
- CAF header structures

**Relevance:** Informational header - actual CAF file I/O is already handled by `AudioFile` API. Adding these structures would only help developers parsing CAF files manually (rare).

**Recommendation:** Very low priority - no functional gap.

---

### 5. **AudioCodec Component API**
**Priority: Low-Medium** - Low-level codec interface

**What it provides:**
- Direct codec component management
- Custom encoder/decoder control
- Packet-level audio translation

**Relevance:** Very low-level API. Most use cases covered by `AudioConverter` (higher-level) and `ExtendedAudioFile` (even higher-level). Direct codec access needed only for custom codec implementations or highly specialized workflows.

**Recommendation:** Low priority - `AudioConverter` covers 95% of use cases.

---

## Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. ✅ **Streaming and Async I/O** 🎯 **[COMPLETED]**
**Priority: HIGH**

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**What was implemented:**
```python
import asyncio
import coremusic as cm

# Async file reading with chunk streaming
async with cm.AsyncAudioFile("large_file.wav") as audio:
    async for chunk in audio.read_chunks_async(chunk_size=4096):
        await process_audio_chunk(chunk)

# Async AudioQueue playback
format = cm.AudioFormat(44100.0, 'lpcm', channels_per_frame=2, bits_per_channel=16)
async with await cm.AsyncAudioQueue.new_output_async(format) as queue:
    await queue.start_async()
    await asyncio.sleep(1.0)
    await queue.stop_async()

# Concurrent file processing
results = await asyncio.gather(
    process_file("file1.wav"),
    process_file("file2.wav"),
    process_file("file3.wav")
)

# NumPy integration for signal processing
async with cm.AsyncAudioFile("audio.wav") as audio:
    async for chunk in audio.read_chunks_numpy_async(chunk_size=1024):
        spectrum = np.fft.fft(chunk)
        await process_spectrum(spectrum)
```

### 2. **SciPy Integration** 🎯
**Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Gap:** NumPy integration exists, but no SciPy signal processing utilities.

**What to add:**
```python
# Signal processing utilities
audio_file = cm.AudioFile("audio.wav")
data = audio_file.read_frames_numpy()  # Already exists

# New: Built-in signal processing
filtered = audio_file.apply_filter(scipy.signal.butter(5, 1000, 'low', fs=44100))
resampled = audio_file.resample(target_rate=48000)
spectrum = audio_file.compute_fft()

# Or extend AudioFormat
format = cm.AudioFormat(44100, 'lpcm', channels_per_frame=2, bits_per_channel=16)
filter_coeffs = format.design_filter(cutoff=1000, filter_type='lowpass')
```

**Benefits:**
- Seamless audio DSP workflows

    output_dir="converted/",
    progress_callback=lambda f, c, t: print(f"Converting {f} ({c}/{t})")
)

# File conversion
cm.convert_audio_file("input.wav", "output.wav",
                      cm.AudioFormatPresets.wav_44100_mono())
