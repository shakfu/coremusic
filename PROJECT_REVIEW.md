## Missing/Unwrapped APIs

### 1. **AudioWorkInterval** (macOS 10.16+, iOS 14.0+)
**Priority: Medium-Low** - Advanced feature for realtime workgroup management

**What it provides:**
- OS workgroup creation for realtime audio threads
- Thread deadline coordination across processes
- CPU usage optimization for power vs. performance

**Relevance:** Highly specialized - needed only for advanced audio apps creating custom realtime threads. Most apps use device-owned workgroups automatically.

**Recommendation:** Low priority - niche use case for professional audio developers.

---

### 2. **CoreAudioClock** (macOS-only)
**Priority: Medium** - Synchronization and timing services

**What it provides:**
- Audio/MIDI synchronization
- SMPTE timecode support
- MIDI Time Code (MTC) and MIDI beat clock
- Tempo maps and time conversions
- Clock sources (audio devices, host time, external sync)

**Relevance:** Essential for DAWs, sequencers, and sync-dependent applications. Overlaps partially with MusicPlayer tempo functionality but provides broader sync capabilities.

**Recommendation:** Medium priority - would enhance pro audio and post-production use cases.

---

### 3. **AudioHardwareTapping** (macOS 14.2+)
**Priority: Low** - Recent addition, Objective-C only

**What it provides:**
- Process audio tapping (capture audio from other processes)
- Requires Objective-C (`CATapDescription` class)

**Relevance:** Very specialized - audio monitoring/routing utilities, system-wide audio capture.

**Recommendation:** Low priority - requires Objective-C bridge, limited applicability.

---

### 4. **CAFFile Data Structures**
**Priority: Low** - Informational only

**What it provides:**
- Core Audio Format (CAF) file chunk definitions
- CAF header structures

**Relevance:** Informational header - actual CAF file I/O is already handled by `AudioFile` API. Adding these structures would only help developers parsing CAF files manually (rare).

**Recommendation:** Very low priority - no functional gap.

---

### 5. **AudioCodec Component API**
**Priority: Low-Medium** - Low-level codec interface

**What it provides:**
- Direct codec component management
- Custom encoder/decoder control
- Packet-level audio translation

**Relevance:** Very low-level API. Most use cases covered by `AudioConverter` (higher-level) and `ExtendedAudioFile` (even higher-level). Direct codec access needed only for custom codec implementations or highly specialized workflows.

**Recommendation:** Low priority - `AudioConverter` covers 95% of use cases.

---

## Enhancement Opportunities

        await process_audio(chunk)

# Async AudioQueue playback with callbacks
queue = cm.AudioQueue.new_output_async(format)
await queue.start_async()
```

**Benefits:**
- Non-blocking file I/O for large files
- Better integration with modern Python async frameworks

audio_file = cm.AudioFile("audio.wav")
data = audio_file.read_frames_numpy()  # Already exists

# New: Built-in signal processing
filtered = audio_file.apply_filter(scipy.signal.butter(5, 1000, 'low', fs=44100))
resampled = audio_file.resample(target_rate=48000)
spectrum = audio_file.compute_fft()

# Or extend AudioFormat
format = cm.AudioFormat(44100, 'lpcm', channels_per_frame=2, bits_per_channel=16)
filter_coeffs = format.design_filter(cutoff=1000, filter_type='lowpass')
```

**Benefits:**

    def detect_silence(audio_file, threshold_db=-40):
        """Detect silence regions in audio file"""

    @staticmethod
    def normalize_loudness(audio_file, target_lufs=-16):
        """Normalize audio to target LUFS"""

    @staticmethod
    def extract_features(audio_file):
        """Extract MFCC, spectral features, etc."""

# Audio effects chain builder
effects = (cm.EffectsChain(audio_file)
    .add_eq(freq=1000, gain=3.0, q=1.0)
    .add_compressor(threshold=-20, ratio=4.0)
    .add_reverb(room_size=0.5))
processed = effects.process()

# Simple batch processing
cm.batch_convert(
    input_pattern="*.mp3",
    output_format=cm.AudioFormat.wav_44100_stereo(),
    output_dir="converted/"
)
```
